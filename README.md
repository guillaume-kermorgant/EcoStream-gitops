# EcoStream-gitops

---

:warning:
**This project was originally hosted on GitLab and moved to GitHub when I reached GitLab's free tier limit.**
**I have left the .gitlab-ci.yml files as is, most of the instructions to deploy the application will not work because they rely on GitLab's services (e.g. container registries)**

**TODO: update all EcoStream repositories to use GitHub actions and some independent container registry instead of GitLab services.**

This repo contains ArgoCD resources to deploy EcoStream
